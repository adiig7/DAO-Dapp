# DAO-Dapp

A Dapp made where the DAO members(holders of the `CryptoDevs NFT Token`) can create and vote on proposals for purchasing NFTs from an NFT marketplace.
A user who holds the `CryptoDevs NFT Token` can create a proposal.

## Few things to Remember
- For each proposal, each NFT counts as one vote.
- Anyone who has a CryptoDevs NFT can make a proposal to buy another NFT from an NFT marketplace.
- Every CryptoDevs NFT holder has the ability to vote for or against the active proposals.
- A voter cannot vote on the same proposal with the same NFT more than once.
- If majority of the voters vote for the proposal by the deadline, the NFT purchase is automatically executed
